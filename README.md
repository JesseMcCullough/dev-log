# Dev Log

My personal log for software development work and learning. I use it to track progress over time and reflect on what I'm learning. Entries are kept minimal and may reference work done in other repositories, typically including a date and brief notes on what I worked on or learned.

> Note: Updates reflect real work and learning. Frequency may vary.

- Learned templating with EJS on Express (reminds me of PHP in some ways)

## December 18, 2025

-   Created this repo as a place to track my software development work and learning
-   Implemented a Stack and a Queue from scratch; reviewed their Big-O time complexities
-   Built a basic Express server and learned:
    -   Handling GET and POST requests
    -   Using `req.params` vs `req.query`
