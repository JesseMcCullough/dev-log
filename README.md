# Dev Log

My personal log for software development work and learning. I use it to track progress over time and reflect on what I'm learning. Entries are kept minimal and may reference work done in other repositories, typically including a date and brief notes on what I worked on or learned.

> Note: Updates reflect real work and learning. Frequency may vary.
