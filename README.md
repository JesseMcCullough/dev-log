# Dev Log

My personal log for software development work and learning. I use it to track progress over time and reflect on what I'm learning. Entries are kept minimal and may reference work done in other repositories, typically including a date and brief notes on what I worked on or learned.

> Note: Updates reflect real work and learning. Frequency may vary.

## January 1, 2026
- Learned about:
  - Contiguous memory usage in arrays
  - Pros and cons of arrays vs. linked lists
- Became aware of:
  - Bit manipulation
  - Sliding window
  - Two pointers
  - Prefix sum

## December 31, 2025
- Learned about:
  - Depth-first search
  - Tree traversals:
    - `inorder`
    - `preorder`
    - `postorder`
  - Memoization

## December 30, 2025
- Learned about graphs
- Reviewed recursion
- Reviewed searching algorithms:
  - `linear search`
  - `binary search`
- Learned about sorting algorithms:
  - `bubble sort`
  - `selection sort`
  - `insertion sort`
  - `merge sort`
  - `quick sort`
  - Skimmed: `radix sort`, `counting sort`
  - Learned what makes a sorting algorithm `stable` vs. `unstable`
- Learned about breadth-first search
- Attempted creating a monorepo from my [webdev-sandbox](https://github.com/JesseMcCullough/webdev-sandbox) repo that other projects can link to... work in progress

## December 29, 2025
- Learned about Binary Search Trees and their Big-O time complexities
- Reviewed JavaScript array methods: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` 

## December 23, 2025
- Learned how JavaScript packages work with npm and how `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `node_modules` relate to each other
- Reviewed a high-level overview of monolithic vs. microservices architecture

## December 19, 2025
- Learned templating with EJS on Express (reminds me of PHP in some ways)

## December 18, 2025
-   Created this repo as a place to track my software development work and learning
-   Implemented a Stack and a Queue from scratch; reviewed their Big-O time complexities
-   Built a basic Express server and learned:
    -   Handling GET and POST requests
    -   Using `req.params` vs `req.query`
